# vue_tree
just a sample of tree


here is two kind of trees, one is d3.js tree, the other is echarts tree.
i'd prefer to use d3.js cause it's highly configuralbe. 

but this project is for the bank, no third party libray allowed, except those are get permision by the censor staff.

so, i use echarts of which already imported by them.


i still at working until the last day of the year, it's a greay pity !!!
